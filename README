this little rails application is the attempt to visualize a neo4j database
with graphviz. it is meant as a starting point for a more general solution,
i.e. a neo4j database explorer.

prerequisites
=============

http://jruby.org/
http://www.graphviz.org/
http://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j/
http://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz

be sure that the graphviz executables (dot.exe etc.) can be found in the path.

neoviz loads yahoo YUI libraries from internet.

neoviz produces SVG images. is you are using the internet explorer, you must
install the adobe svg viewer. safari and firebox have built-in svg support.

have fun !
